?	Why is it necessary to erase the startup configuration before reloading the router?

The router loads the current memory and becomes the running-config.  So to erase the current startup-config will return the router to its basic configuation.  When reloaded. 

?	You find a couple configurations issues after saving the running configuration to the startup configuration, so you make the necessary changes to fix those issues. If you were to reload the device now, what configuration would be restored to the device after the reload?

The configuartion you originally had and the changes you made.
